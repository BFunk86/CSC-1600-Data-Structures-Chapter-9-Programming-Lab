# CSC-1600-Data-Structures-Chapter-9-Programming-Lab
This is the Chapter 9 Programming Lab for CSC 1600 Data Structures at Jamestown Community College

Project Description:

Design and implement the following classes and write a test program:
<ol>
  <li>An abstract class Employee that represents a generic employee that has fields for name, address, ssn, and department. Include methods to retrieve information about an employee and save it as EmployeeYourLastName.java.</li>
  <li>A subclass of Employee called HourlyEmployee that describes an employee who gets paid by the hour. Include a public method called pay() that returns the pay of the employee for that week, and any other relevant methods to manage data ﬁelds such as hourly wage and number of hours worked and save it as HourlyEmployeeYourLastName.java.</li>
  <li>A subclass of Employee called SalariedEmployee that describes an employee who gets paid a ﬁxed salary every month. Include a public method called pay() that returns the pay of the employee for that month, and any other relevant methods to manage data ﬁelds such as yearly salary and any unpaid leave taken that month and save it as SalariedEmployeeYourLastName.java.</li>
  <li>Write a test program to test thoroughly the classes you have designed and save it as DriverPayYourLastName.java.</li>  
</ol>
